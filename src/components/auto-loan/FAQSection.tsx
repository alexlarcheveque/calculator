        <p className="mb-2">
          An auto loan is a secured loan specifically for purchasing vehicles,
          where the car serves as collateral to protect the lender.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          <strong>How auto loans work:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-sm mb-3">
          <li>
            <strong>Secured financing:</strong> Vehicle serves as collateral,
            enabling lower rates
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fixed payments:</strong> Equal monthly payments over the
            loan term
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Repossession risk:</strong> Lender can seize vehicle if
            payments stop
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Title transfer:</strong> You own the car but lender holds
            title until paid off
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-sm">
          <strong>Common terms:</strong> 36-84 months with rates typically 3-12%

    answer: (

        <p className="mb-2">
          Monthly auto loan payments are calculated using the loan amount,
          interest rate, and loan term with this formula:
        </p>
        <p className="font-mono bg-gray-100 p-2 rounded text-sm mb-3">
          M = P Ã— [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n-1]
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          Where: M = monthly payment, P = principal (loan amount), r = monthly
          interest rate, n = number of payments
