        <p className="mb-2">
          An amortized loan is repaid through regular, equal payments over a set
          period, with each payment covering both principal and interest.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          <strong>How amortization works:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-sm mb-3">
          <li>
            <strong>Early payments:</strong> Mostly interest, small principal
            reduction
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Middle payments:</strong> Gradually shift toward more
            principal
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Late payments:</strong> Mostly principal, small interest
            portion
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Final payment:</strong> Loan balance reaches zero
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-sm">
          <strong>Common examples:</strong> Mortgages, auto loans, personal
          loans, and student loans. This structure ensures predictable monthly
          payments while building equity over time.

          Monthly loan payments are calculated using the principal amount,

          Compound interest means you pay interest on both the principal and any

          Deferred payment loans require no regular payments during the loan
