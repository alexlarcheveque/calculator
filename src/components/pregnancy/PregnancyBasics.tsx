          Pregnancy typically lasts about 40 weeks (280 days) from the last
          menstrual period (LMP) or 38 weeks from conception. Understanding how
          pregnancy is calculated and what to expect during each stage helps you
          prepare for this incredible journey.

          Healthcare providers use gestational age, which starts from the first
          day of your last menstrual period, even though conception typically
          occurs about two weeks later. This standardized method ensures
          consistent tracking across all pregnancies.
