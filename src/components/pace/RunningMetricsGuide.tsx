          Running metrics provide valuable insights into your performance and
          help track progress over time. Understanding key metrics like pace,
          cadence, heart rate, and power can transform your training from
          guesswork into precise, data-driven improvement.

          Focus on trends rather than single data points. Use metrics to guide
          training decisions, identify when to push harder or rest, and track
          long-term progress. Remember that metrics are tools to support your
          running, not replace listening to your body.
